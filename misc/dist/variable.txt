There are two flavors of variable Inter to choose from:

- Inter.var.ttf & Inter-Italic.var.ttf
  Family called "Inter"

- InterV.var.ttf & InterV-Italic.var.ttf
  Family called "Inter V" which is identical to "Inter" with the family
  name as the only exception.
  Useful when you want to install traditional static font files alongside
  the variable version.

Note that variable fonts is relatively new technology, with varying
degrees of support in operating systems, web browsers and apps.

If you're in doubt or uncertain about variable fonts, then you probably
don't need to use a variable font. Instead, install the fonts in the
"Desktop" folder.
